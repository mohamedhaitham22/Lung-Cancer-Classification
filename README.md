# Lung-Cancer-Classification
In this project, we used deep learning to detect lung cancer using 15,000 images from a public Kaggle dataset. We focused on three lung tissue types and applied preprocessing like resizing and color normalization. Models like VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetB3 helped us achieve high accuracy to support faster, accurate diagnosis.
